<h3>When someone you love gets hit by a moving vehicle, you expect them to receive top-notch medical attention ASAP. No matter the deductible! No matter the copay! When it comes to family, you pay whatever it takes (even though he/she most likely wasn’t paying the slightest attention to their surroundings).  At Roadkill Hospice Advocacy, we believe that animals are people too!  
We acknowledge that running over animals is both a right and a privilege, however there is an alternative to leaving our dead furry mammal friends on the road.  Can you guess what it is?</h3>

<strong>That’s right!</strong>

<h3>Hospice care is the logical choice--both morally and financially--for roadkill.  With baby boomers reaching their 60s and 70s, the demand for hospice care will soon be at an all-time high.  Although losing your elderly loved ones might provide a short-term emotional sting, a booming hospice industry will lead to broader and cheaper access for all species.  Overall, this is a true home run!

<h1><u>Donating</u></h1>
</div>
<h3> There are an average of 1.5 million insurance claims in the US due to roadkill each year. This statistic only scratches the surface--just like an elk grazing the side of a fast-approaching 18 wheeler--with many more incidents going unclaimed each year. As you can see, the need for your help is very real. Every dollar makes a difference. Your support would be greatly appreciated.
</div>
<h4> That's not all... Your donations will make you eligible for very <strong> fun </strong> prizes! </h4>
